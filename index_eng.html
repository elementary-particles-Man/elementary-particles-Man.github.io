            <p>This site provides an overview and official documents for Libra/Scales Capitalism (LSC).</p>
            <p>The information on this homepage can be used without permission and without restriction, with the exceptions noted below.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>The only restriction is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prohibition of "modifying references to LSC itself, and the promulgation of incorrect LSC."</span></p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>Among these, "references" are generally positive (welcomed).</p>
            <p>However, it would be problematic if I were unaware of such mentions,</p>
            <p>so please contact me (via E-mail, tweets with mentions, etc.).</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>It is an unexpected joy for me that you discuss LSC,</p>
            <p>but as you will understand if you read it, this is a "proposition that denies propositions."</p>
            <p>Therefore, if any "restriction" arises from this, it is generally a mistake.</p>
            <p>(The constraint of not being able to think in existing ways is precisely the raison d'être of LSC.)</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>For those who find it tedious to read the official documents, an official overview is provided here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>LSC is named "Capitalism" because its ultimate goal is the "coexistence of financial markets and the real economy," but the essence of LSC is a "General-Purpose Reality Improvement Thinking Support System" (personally, I consider it a "Philosophy of Paradox").<br><br></li>
                <li>What makes LSC decisively different from other "-isms" is that "achievement" is not the goal, and there is no "should be." It's not that there isn't one at all, but if I had to put it simply, it's just "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Let's free ourselves from the burdensome.</span></strong>"<br><br></li>
                <li>LSC is the complete opposite of "immutable and eternal." It is a principle of being "variable and adaptable." If there's one unchanging aspect, it's the continuous cycle of "starting from reality and aiming for the improvement of reality" as its fundamental approach. The starting point of the next cycle will be the "improved reality," so if LSC becomes inconsistent at that time, LSC itself will be transformed accordingly to continuously and directly approach reality.<br><br></li>
                <li>For this purpose, LSC is broadly divided into a "Core Concept" and "Module Construction." The "Core Concept" merely consists of seven "provisional truths." This part might be somewhat challenging, but understanding these seven core concepts makes you an LSC master. Modules are simply created by combining the core concepts to specialize in various real-world problems.</li>

                            <p>The Preciousness of Abnormality<br>"'Death is normal, life is abnormal'; 'Sleep is normal, wakefulness is abnormal'; 'War is normal, peace is abnormal.' &rarr; Abnormality, being a temporary state, possesses uniqueness and lacks reproducibility."</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Form is Emptiness, Emptiness is Form = Nothing is Everything; Everything is Nothing<br>"'There is no eternal existence in the world, and it's likely all derived from the Big Bang, but for the nth time.' As times change, values change; as situations change, meanings change. Just as a ray of hope can be seen in the depths of despair, or innovative ideas can be born from a zero base, 0 and &infin; are equivalent."</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Universalization of Relativity <br>"'There are no absolute values or meanings in the world. Everything changes depending on the observer and their state. However, life alone is the sole absolute exception.' &rarr; 'Does a drowning person want water?' 'A thirsty person in the desert would buy a cup of water, right?' &rarr; 'The 10 years from age 10 to 20, and the 10 years from age 60 to 70. Their meanings are completely different, aren't they?' &rarr; 'But, for any observer in any position, the birth of life alone is absolutely significant.'"<br><br></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The Existence of the Sole "Absent Scale"<br>"'A scale to measure the unquantifiable simply does not exist in this world.' &rarr; Many people try to assert superiority through comparative advantages regarding 'humanity,' 'effort,' or 'happiness,' don't they? &rarr; You might feel like you're 'winning' for a moment, but that can't last. It's impossible. Such a scale doesn't exist anywhere."</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Temporal Relativity of Justice<br>"'Complete Rejection of Political Correctness.' &rarr; Today's justice operates only by today's rules, and judging the past by them is arrogant. &rarr; If you do that, you'll be heavily criticized by future generations, but you're not prepared for that, are you?"</p>

                            <p>Unconditional Affirmation of Existence and Gratitude<br>"'The reason a person is not just a 'person' (biological entity) but a 'human being' (social and spiritual one) is because, to confront a hundred years of solitude, one needs an entity that 'unconditionally and unrestrictedly affirms one's own existence.'' &rarr; 'Even the evil you seek to judge might be such an indispensable existence to someone else.'"</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>All Truth is Conditional / Dependent on Prerequisites<br>"'When astronauts return to Earth, they're surprised that bottles fall, right? A classic example.'"</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>That's all. Truly, just this.</p>
            <p>I've provided a rough explanation, but if you can understand LSC with this, you don't need to read the lengthy documents.</p>
            <p>As you can see, none of these individual points are particularly novel, and frankly, I don't consider them groundbreaking myself.</p>
            <p>However, I have a strange conviction that there is probably no 'reality' that cannot be approached by transforming, developing, and combining these core concepts.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>In fact, "probable truths" such as "'Supremacist ideology is foolish and wrong,' 'Nothing is perfect in the world,' 'Since everything in the world is imperfect, it is futile and unproductive for the imperfect to discriminate against the imperfect,' and 'If you want a relationship to last long, ultimately only Win-Win can be established,'" can be generated instantly (I am currently thinking of creating these as a library to assist in module construction).</p>
            <p>- Creation of a library<br>- Method for constructing modules specialized in approaching reality (the "Other" in "01 (Guilty/Not Guilty) / Balance / Other")<br></p>
            <p>I am currently working on this area.</p>
            <p>Well, personally, my motto is "Use any available means to achieve your goal," so I believe there's fundamentally no need to even understand the core concepts; if you just feed the official documents to an AI you use, it will likely create the modules for you.</p>
